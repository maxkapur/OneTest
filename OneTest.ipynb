    "# Admissions markets with a single scoring criterion and MNL choice\n",
    "Let’s consider a special kind of admissions market that has not received much attention in the school-choice literature but approximates the admissions procedure used in many systems around the world, such as college admissions in South Korea and China. In the *single-score* model, all schools share the same ranking over the students; for example, they care exclusively about students' scores on a specific standardized test. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this model, students use the *multinomial logit choice* model. This means that each school has a given *quality* $\\delta_c$. Given a set of admitted schools $C^\\#$, students attend school $c$ with probability $$\\frac{\\exp \\delta_c}{\\sum_{d \\in C^\\#} \\exp \\delta_d}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For convenience, let $\\gamma_c \\equiv \\exp \\delta_c$. Since the equation above is homogeneous in $\\gamma$, we may assume without loss of generality that $\\sum \\gamma_c = 1$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Observe that the single-score model is equivalent to the ideal case of single tiebreaking, in which a central agency assigns (by lottery) an admissions priority ranking to each student. Alternatively, the single-score can be interpreted as a linear combination of various dimensions of student characteristics; this is also an accurate reflection of real-world admissions practice, in which schools allocate a certain scoring weight to test scores, grades, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Demand function\n",
    "Without loss of generality, assume schools are ordered by cutoff, i.e. that\n",
    "$$p_1 \\leq p_2 \\leq \\dots \\leq p_{|C|}$$\n",
