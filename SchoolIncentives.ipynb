    "\n",
    "Previous research has dodged the notion of school objective functions because it is hard to define a total ordering over the set of sets of students. However, it is worth considering what forms such objective functions could take, and attempting to inverse optimize for their parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The possible \"ingredients\" of a school objective function are the cutoff $p$, the demand $D$, and the integral of scores over the set of admitted students $L$. $D$ and $L$ are functions of $p$. As argued in the paper, $L$ is shaped much like $D$, but lacks its desirable property of convexity, so I will disregard $L$ here. And $D$ is a function of $p$, so ultimately our school objectives $u_c$ will be too.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective function should be increasing in $p$ and $D$, and it would be nice to have a parameter $\\sigma$ that expresses the school's preference for \"selectivity\" over \"large class size.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "It is apparent from the shape of the demand curve that a linear form such as $u_c= D_c + \\sigma p_c$ is unsuitable. Then the optimum will *always* occur at $p=0$ or $p=1$ (or both, in an edge case). \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, consider the *product* $D_c \\cdot p_c^{\\sigma}$, which can have its optimum anywhere on the open segment. Taking the log, it suffices to assume each school wants to maximize the following utility function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u_c(p_c) = \\log D_c + \\sigma \\log p_c$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I show that this form of the utility function allows us to capture the heterogeneous behavior of schools in selecting their cutoffs. Although nonconcave, it is piecewise concave in a finite number of pieces, so finding the maximum is quite easy. It is also differentiable, so we can dream up a variety of iterative strategies. "
